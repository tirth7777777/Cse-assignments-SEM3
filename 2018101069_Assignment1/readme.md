In Q1 for reversing file command user need to compile code Q1.c and then run output file with name of file needed to
 reverse as argument then reverse file will be generated and stored in Assignment directory.
for eg:-
	gcc -o "Any name you want" Q1.c
	./"Name you chose" "filename needed to reverse"
	output is in ./Assignment/"Filename"
Percentage of the file reversed will be shown on terminal as output.




In Q2 User need to compile code Q2.c and then enter reversed file , original file , directory name as first second and third argument to compiled filed 
respectively. 
for eg:-gcc -o "Any name you want" Q2.c
	./"Name you chose" "reversed file" "original file" "directory"
Output of program tells the permission of all the files, whether directory exist or not and if first file is reverse of other or not.
